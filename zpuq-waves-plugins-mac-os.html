I have been having problems with it, though: - The VSTS don't show up in the browser, even after rescanning and restarting. I checked my VST folder, and the waveshell.vst file is in there, but no other waves files. anyone know what's going on, and/or how I can get it to work? - I've been using the Audio Units instead, and they mostly work OK, except that when I put them onto a track, at first.

My MacBook pro retina late 2013 keeps spontaneously restarting. I’ll be working and all of a sudden the whole computer will freeze, beep a few times and then restart. Sometimes it will just shutdown and I’ll have a to manually power it on again. I’ve done hardware diagnostics (cmd+r) and nothing came up.

So I used to use Modelsim for simulating Verilog and observing the waveforms (I never really used test benches). The problem, however, is that I am using a Mac. Since Modelsim can't run on Mac, I have to use Parallels to run Windows 8 at the same time and run Modelsim in there.
