                            <p> Hello. I have tried to read and watch as much information as possible regarding Chromecast, Firestick and Android Box, but it seems there is a gray area (the one I'm interested in), that is: connecting a laptop to a tv and using the tv as a secondary monitor. Basically, I use my laptop to watch videos/films/tv series on VLC, or watch sport on Acestream or on the browser tabs (Opera Browser, in my case). Sometimes I also use Popcorn Time. Now, I'd like to "send" what I see on VLC, Acestream Just bought a new samsung smart TV. Don't have cable and need to watch my Devils suck it up. What's the best way to go about doing this?

If that's not for you i understand. I use stream screen mirroring. If you want to promote your stream in this thread i would approve of that. Fight the good fight. Is there a way to watch streams from this sub on an apple tv without having to airplay from a laptop/phone. ## My friend has been saving up for a very long time in her quest to get +10 Halloween Henry as he's one of her favorites. She's managed to hoard over 2400 F2P orbs for this! At our insistence, she also graciously decided to stream all of her pulls for everyone to come and watch and enjoy. Here's the link for people who'd like to show some support or just pass by for a chill stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4bq5D6k8qU (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4bq5D. Sup guys! Is there any way to stream/cast Reddit content (specially multireddits) on Chromecast, leaving aside screen-mirroring? I'm fine with streaming only subreddits, but it had to be something able to stream videos images 
I have mostly been watching on my iPad, but for the Mexican GP today I tried airplaying to my Apple TV. Previously, this would send the stream to my TV in 16:9 and I could lock my iPad. Now, my only option is airplay mirroring which projects my iPad screen in the iPad aspect ratio. I thought maybe a program like Reflector 3, but it looks like that's not compatible with my Surface, just my iPhone. Will Google Chromecast allow me to screen mirror from acestream Hey - just wondering if anyone out there knows of a hack to be able to beam A-League matches from a Telstra mobile to an LG SmartTV. I tried to use a couple of those screen beaming apps (Mirror LG TV), LG TV Plus, TV Cast LG) but the MyFootball app knows one of those apps is being used, and the transmission doesn't continue. Is there an app out there that is 'undetectable' by MyFootball so I can beam it to an LG SmartTV? Thanks in advance. Yes I know Comcast has a pretty bad rep, but they are the only provider in my area so I have to use them. What I was looking for is a tweak that will work on the iOS 11 electra jailbreak that will bypass the app detecting that you are sharing the screen so I can put movies up on my tv through screen mirroring. Not sure if this is possible but would be very cool if someone could put something like this together.

I watch matches on the daily motion app which sucks cuz I have to wait a day or two after. I'm planning to get the world to watch Omega/Oakada IV but I don't wanna sit there with my phone for 3 hours. Morning all. I normally provide in-person demos, but sometimes the travel time isn’t justifiable, so I’m working on figuring out a way to perform live web demos of an iOS app I provide. There don’t seem to be many options. There’s an iOS emulator for Xcode. if it’s my own app but that’s not the case. I also found third party emulator “simulators” that have their own App Store, but don’t run “real” iOS apps. Does anyone have any suggestions on doing live online iOS demos? Thank. Crunchy roll is always fucking up. Is there any alternatives you guys recommend? I usually stream off my xbox so it would Anyone know if a way to mirror to Windows? I want to do a presentation about Recently got this TV and had trouble finding out how to get a browser on it. When I finally figured it out, I got the Vewd web browser. So two things: One, I think it sucks. Two, what's the easiest way to navigate the TV with? I tried the Android remote app, but it is't what I thought it would be.
