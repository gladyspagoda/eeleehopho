Krusader is an advanced twin panel (commander style) file manager for KDE Plasma and other desktops in the nix world, similar to Midnight or Total Commander. I posted another topic (https://www.reddit.com/r/unRAID/comments/9tu4sf/share_movies_set_to_not_use_the_cache_but_files/) about this previously, and thought everything was fixed. I set my TV/Movies cache preference to "yes", ran mover, then set them back to no. The errors went away, but now the exact same error is being given. I do not understand how files can leak onto my cache drive if I have "use cache" set to no, can someone please help? amp#x200B; Thanks. Krusader 2.0.0 скачать для Linux.

Must I use rclone and terminal? I am a lifelong Windows user and after a couple weeks I realize I work with GUI much better than terminals. I am fine with Linux. I am trying to migrate away from Duplicati and Gsuite seems to fit the bill with rclone. But I am having issues. amp#x200B; Using SpaceIn.

I have a decent knowledge of unRAID, Docker, Linux, but for the life of me and no matter how much research I do I cannot figure out this Bash Scripting and the XMLTV.sock file in Unix. I have a URL from my IPTV provider and I have all of the Muxes added as Channels, but I cannot figure out how to point my URL for XMLTV listings to TVheadend under unRAID. It shows the directory of the xmltv.sock file as /config/epggrab/xmltv.sock. Which using CMD line and Krusader I have found under /mnt/user/. Установи Linux!

Hey guys. I'm new to unraid, only 3 days into the free trial and I love it. I'm not super experienced working with linux but I try my best. Right now I only have 4 docker containers installed, deluge, netdata, plex, and krusader. I have them set up so they run on my cache disk (ssd). The problem is the docker.img file in system/docker is 21.5GB. This seems awfully large. When I run docker system df it only shows about 4gb used, same when I click the container size button in the docker Description: Krusader is a simple, easy, powerful, twin-panel (commander-style) file manager, similar to Midnight Commander (C) or Total Commander. First of all thank you so much for the great podcast that you produce and for all the hard work that you do within the Linux space! Second I would like to make clear that I am not associated in any way with the project that I am about to mention. I'm just someone that started using their great app so wanted to give them a shout out. I also think that their app would make for a worthy discussion on your podcast. I got extremely fed-up using the dolphin file manager within KDE as it's very buggy. 
Download krusader packages for Arch Linux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD, Mageia, OpenMandriva, openSUSE, PCLinuxOS, ROSA, Slackware, Ubuntu. Unraid noob here with no clue what I'm doing. I've been following spaceinvader's video on setting up Krusader but since that version is deprecated I'm completely lost trying to set up the binhex version. Can someone give me a step by step guide please? I don't understand the host paths and container paths stuff. I only have a little bit of experience with Linux so even though I'm sure this is super basic for you guys this is stressful stuff Krusader был основан в мае 2000 года Ши Эрлихом (Shie Erlich) и Рафи Янаи (Rafi Yanai), главным образом потому, что не было альтернативы программе Total Commander для Linux. I have a dual boot Neon and Windows 7 computer with the two installed on separate Pharisaical drives. When I boot Neon Linux and navigate in Dolphin to the Windows drive users\me\music\singles Dolphin sees 85 files 485.7 MiB But in Krusader I see the actual file count and size 179 files 925.3 MiB. I have setup my machine similarly in the past with Mint and Neon and have not had this problem. FYI: I am running Dolphin 18.12.2 and Krusader 2.7.1. Neon is patched Krusader is awesome; I just wish it would incorporate a feature that would change the current directory view to the directory the user cd's into the terminal. 
I used to use Total Commander in the good old windows days to sync my local drives with my NAS. In linux I usually just use gigolo for gvfs, but that does not work in crostini. I have found the best replacement for me, so far, to be Krusader. Once dolphin and konqueror are installed KIO started working and I could start accessing the NAS over SMB by typing 192.168.x.y into the bar, it even comes up with the different share names on the address (my seagate has "External Storage", "GoFlex Krusader is primarily developed for the Linux platform, but it is available for some other platforms.

They are visible in others like in Firefox save files dialogue, file browser etc. But in applications like qbittorrent and ktorrent the file dialogue doesn't show the ntfs partitions. When I disable ntfs-3g the partitions are visible in the file dialogue but couldn't write.

I followed the video exactly and if I use bride in the container template it give a server error on start up.

I've noticed this issue once in a while, where some of my share folders seemed to have duplicated. I think I recently identified it as a Mover issue. I normally have the folders 'tv shows' and 'movies', but will sometimes find new folders named 'TV Shows' and 'Movies' containing only my latest files. Linux can handle the case sensitivity, but it confuses my Windows machines. I found today in the Mover logs, that it is indeed moving the new files to both the lowercase folders first Download Krusader for Linux - A powerful and easy-to-use twin-panel (commander-style) file manager for KDE and Linux. I'm setting up a new unRAID and coming from previously using Windows Server 2012 with DrivePool and SnapRAID. I bought a bunch of the WD Red 8TB EasyStores, shucked them, and should have plenty of space to copy over the data without having to touch/format the previous drives. So I have unRAID running and my new 8TB drives in the array, no parity currently as I hear that can slow down transfers quite a bit so I will add a couple later for that purpose after everything is copied over (also Hi there! Guys can you help me a little bit with Krusader. It's a very cool file manager and I'd like to use it but there's quite a big problem. 
Hi all, I've played with Linux on and off over the years, but it was early 2016 that I installed Gallium OS and it really blew my away. From the beginning it just felt "right" and inspired me to probe deeper into Linux. Now, many months on, as much as I love Chromebooks and Chrome OS, I really feel that Linux, through Gallium, just rockets the multipurpose value of CB's into the stratosphere. Now it's my daily driver on all my Chromebooks. I've installed and uninstalled and reinstalled. Как установить krusader через терминал в Ubuntu / Linux Mint / Debian Linux.

No mime types installed. I have been a long time KDE user but have read good things about XFCE. As I was due an upgrade from LinuxMint KDE I decided to try out Xubuntu. So far its been pretty good. Only things I am missing are Short cuts for window moving - such as move to next monitor (multi monitor setup). Or move windows where KDE has a 'smart' move function - rather than the snail pace using arrow keys. Krusader - really liked this orthodox file manager. Any tools or tricks in Xubuntu/XFCE? Any recommended. Konqueror, KDE's default file manager and browser, is a good all-around tool, but that doesn't necessarily mean it fits all your file management needs. Sometimes a dedicated file manager can be a better choice for daily computing. Krusader is a powerful and versatile file manager. I am new to unraid and have recently been downloading a large amount of Linux isos. After invoking the mover to transfer off my cache and onto the array, I still have about 150GB of space used on the cache disk. I am 90% sure this is my fault, as I used the Krusader docker to sort the isos into their correct directories from the temporary download folder on my cache. However, I started doing this before the mover had run, so in fact, the isos were still on my cache disk when I was sorting. 
Krusader - клон Total Commander под Linux и графическую оболочку KDE. Из нового стоит отметить сохранение позиции закладок, новый user-action интерфейс, более эффективное обновление.
